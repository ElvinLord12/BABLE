**Early insights:** Data collection started on the 2nd floor of Phillips Hall and ended at the footsteps going up to Gannet Center Library. Altitude is skewed to start because of the height gained from being on the 2nd floor, altitude was lost as we went downstairs and then rose steadily as we went up 2 flights of stairs towards the library.
